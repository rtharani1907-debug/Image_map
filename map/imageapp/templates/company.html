          OICL was incorporated at Mumbai on 12 September 1947. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company Ltd and was formed to carry out general insurance business. Following the nationalisation of the life insurance business and the formation of the Life Insurance Corporation of India under statutory law, the company became a subsidiary of the Life Insurance Corporation of India from 1956 to 1973 (until the general insurance business was nationalized in the country). Following the nationalisation of the general insurance industry by the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 (GIBNA), the Government of India transferred all the shares it held of the general insurance companies to the General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC). OICL became one of the four subsidiaries of GIC, with its headquarters in New Delhi.
          With the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Act 2002 (40 of 2002) coming into force on March 21, 2003, GIC ceased to be a holding company of its subsidiaries. The ownership of the four erstwhile subsidiary companies and the General Insurance Corporation of India was vested with the Government of India. All company shares held by the GIC were transferred to the central government.
          The Insurance Act of 1938 was the first legislation governing all forms of insurance to provide strict state control over insurance business. Life insurance in India was completely nationalised on 19 January 1956, through the Life Insurance Corporation Act. All 245 insurance companies operating then in the country were merged into one entity, the Life Insurance Corporation of India.
          The primary regulator for insurance in India is the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) which was established in 1999 under the government legislation called the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999.
          The history of agriculture in India dates back to the Neolithic period. India ranks second worldwide in farm outputs. As per the Indian economic survey 2020 -21, agriculture employed more than 50% of the Indian workforce and contributed 20.2% to the country's GDP.
          Pesticides and fertilizers used in Indian agriculture have helped increase crop productivity, but their unregulated and excessive use has caused different ecosystem and fatal health problems.
