They are hand-woven purely from dyed silk-yarn and zari (silk thread made of silver and gold). The saris have an enviable reputation for richness, texture, lustre, durability and finish. 
           The art of silk weaving in Kanchipuram dates back more than 400 years. Legend has it that the weavers of Kanchipuram are descendants of Sage Markanda, the master weaver for the gods. Over centuries, these artisans have honed their skills, blending traditional knowledge with evolving techniques to create masterpieces. The Padma Saliyar and Pattu Saliyar communities are central to this tradition, often working in family units where each member contributes to different aspects of the weaving process.
           Kanchipuram silk sarees, like those offered at Hayagrivas Silk House, are celebrated for their durability, vibrant colors, and intricate patterns inspired by temple architecture, nature, and mythology. Whether youâ€™re seeking a saree with timeless motifs or one with modern elegance, explore the range of traditional bridal Kanchipuram silk sarees and lightweight sarees for daily wear for your perfect match. Each saree is a labor of love, requiring 10-15 days to complete, depending on its complexity.
           Despite the global acclaim of Kanchipuram silk sarees, the weavers face significant challenges, including competition from power looms, rising raw material costs, and inconsistent demand.
